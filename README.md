# tfdepth

## What is this?
An implementation of [stochastic depth](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09382v2.pdf) in the [RESnet](https://github.com/xuyuwei/resnet-tf) architecture using Tensorflow

## What does this do?
Put simply, this is a modification to the RESnet neural network which stochastically skips layers during training. This allows for more efficient and (more importantly) quicker training, without sacrificing model accuracy.
